# Test

This is split into a server and a client. The server is express and the client is react, using parcel to build.
The server is in the server folder and the client is in the client folder. You will need to run them from their folder.

## Build
Go into both folders and run

`yarn`  


## Run
Go into both folders and run

`yarn start`  

for the client, go into browser and use http://localhost:1234

## Tests
Go into both folders and run

`yarn test`

## What would I have added with more time
1. more unit tests
2. richer tree control
3. cypress tests
4. richer ux around saving, eg loading states
